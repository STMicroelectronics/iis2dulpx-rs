# IIS2DULPX Accelerometer and Temperature Data Acquisition on STM32F401RE Nucleo-64

This example demonstrates how to read acceleration and temperature data from the **IIS2DULPX** sensor using an **STM32F401RE** microcontroller. The sensor is configured to generate data-ready interrupts, and the program outputs sensor readings over UART.

---

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F401RE Nucleo-64
- **Sensor:** IIS2DULPX Accelerometer
- **Communication Interface:** I2C1 at 100 kHz Standard Mode
- **UART:** USART2 for serial output at 115200 baud
- **Interrupt Pin:** PA4 configured as input with external interrupt for data-ready signaling

### Default Pin Configuration

| Signal       | STM32F401RE Pin | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| I2C1_SCL     | PB8             | I2C clock line (open-drain)     |
| I2C1_SDA     | PB9             | I2C data line (open-drain)      |
| USART2_TX    | PA2             | UART transmit for debug output  |
| EXTI4 (INT)  | PA4             | External interrupt from sensor data-ready signal |

The IIS2DULPX sensor is connected via I2C1 on PB8/PB9. The data-ready interrupt line is connected to PA4, configured to trigger an external interrupt on rising edge. UART output is routed through PA2.

## Code Description

### Initialization

- The program initializes microcontroller peripherals including clocks, GPIO pins, I2C, UART, and a timer for delays.
- I2C1 is configured at 100 kHz Standard Mode on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA).
- UART is configured on USART2 (PA2) at 115200 baud for serial output.
- PA4 is configured as an input pin with interrupt on rising edge for data-ready signaling.
- The external interrupt is enabled in the NVIC and linked to the EXTI4 interrupt handler.
- The interrupt pin is stored in a mutex-protected static for safe interrupt flag clearing.

### Sensor Configuration

- The IIS2DULPX sensor is initialized over I2C with the high I2C address.
- The sensor is taken out of deep power down mode.
- The device ID is read and verified; if mismatched, the program halts.
- The sensor is reset to default configuration and waits until reset completes.
- Embedded functions are enabled.
- Interrupt routing is configured to output data-ready signals on INT1 pin (PA4).
- Output data rate is set to 25 Hz with Â±4g full scale and low-pass filter.

### Data Acquisition Loop

- The program enters a low-power wait-for-interrupt (WFI) loop.
- When a data-ready interrupt occurs, the program reads acceleration and temperature data.
- Sensor readings are printed over UART.

### Interrupt Handler

- The `EXTI4` interrupt handler clears the interrupt pending bit on PA4 to allow further interrupts.

## Usage

1. Connect the IIS2DULPX sensor to the STM32F401RE Nucleo board via I2C1 (PB8/PB9).
2. Connect the sensor's data-ready interrupt output to PA4 on the STM32F401RE.
3. Build and flash the firmware onto the STM32F401RE board.
4. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud on the USART2 TX line.
5. Observe acceleration and temperature readings printed over UART.

## Notes

- The example uses hardware interrupts to efficiently detect new sensor data.
- UART output uses blocking writes without DMA.
- The environment is `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` for embedded Rust applications.
- Panic behavior is set to halt on panic using `panic_halt`.
